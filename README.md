### Pendings

Test files are pending because I don't understand well the task to do, and I thought that I had to do also the api rest, so I did it in this repo https://github.com/ferranpuigmar/arazapi. I spent two days doing this api rest, and one day fixing all the current front in order to adapt to the real api rest, so I decide deliver the technical test without test files.
